## Previous Names
Until 5/18/2020, this repository was named `R34-Data`.

## Goal
To conduct centralized data cleaning for the study and list projects that analyze 
the study's data. Each data analysis project has its own folder that contains the 
code specific to that project (or a link to the code).

## Data Cleaning
See the [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/TeachmanLab/R34-Data/tree/master/Data%20Cleaning) folder.

**TODO:**

- Jeremy to explain what cleaning scripts are in the `Data Cleaning` folder, how they relate 
to the data used in the main outcomes paper, why additional cleaning was needed, and how the 
cleaning scripts on the present repo differ from the cleaning scripts in a new linked repo [TeachmanLab/MT-Data-ManagingAnxietyStudy-Cleaning](https://github.com/TeachmanLab/MT-Data-ManagingAnxietyStudy-Cleaning)
