## Previous Names
- Until 5/18/2020, this repository was named "R34-Data".

## Goal

- Each data analysis project has its own folder that contains the code specific to that project.

## Data Cleaning
- Check the [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/TeachmanLab/R34-Data/tree/master/Data%20Cleaning) folder for the detailed data-cleaning process
