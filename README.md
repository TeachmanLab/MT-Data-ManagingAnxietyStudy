## Previous Names
- Until 5/18/2020, this repository was named "R34-Data".

## Goal
- We try to have a one document to address all the projects related to _R34_ study and major data cleaning issues.
- Each data analysis project has its own folder that contains the code specific to that project.

## Data Cleaning
- Check the [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/TeachmanLab/R34-Data/tree/master/Data%20Cleaning) folder for the detailed data-cleaning process

## Data on Open Science Framework
Raw and centrally cleaned data of the MindTrails Managing Anxiety Study (R34) are stored in the [MindTrails Managing Anxiety Study](https://osf.io/pvd67/) project on the Open Science Framework (OSF). The project has two components, with different permissions: a Private Component and a Public Component.

### Private Component
The [private component](https://osf.io/5sn2x/) contains full set of 20 raw data tables dumped from () on February 2nd, 2019. Researchers can request access to files on this component by contacting the study team (studyteam@mindtrails.org).

### Public Component
The [Public Component](https://osf.io/2x3jq/) contains a partial set of raw data tables and redacted tables.


## Contact
