### Goal of this repository
- We try to have a one document to address all the projects related to _R34_ study and major data cleaning issues.
- Each data analysis project has its own folder that contains the code specific to that project.

## Main Data cleaning
Here is the main steps for cleaning the data:
- [x] Exclude participants with ID between **20:420**. _They are spam_. 
- [x] Exclude _Admin_ users.
- [x] Prefer not to answer coding (list all tables with different coding)

**NOTE:** Please also review the data cleaning issues that other porjects found in this dataset!!!!
